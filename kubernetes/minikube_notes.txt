Kustomize
- use to configure deployments for different run time environments


using kubernetes deployments object for rolling upgrades.



replace service discovery since kubernetes comes with built-in support for service discovery.

- Netflix Eureka replace with Kubernetes service objects and kube-proxy for service discovery
- Using Kustomize to prepare the microservices to be deployed in different environments
- testing thes deployments witha versiono fthe test script
- performing rolling upgrades
- learning how to roll back a failed upgrade


advantage of using kubernetes discovery service
- doesn't require a client library such as Netflix Ribbon, which we have been using together with Netflix Eureka

drawback
- only works in Kubernetes environment


Kube-proxy(discovery service)
- accepts request to the DNS  name or IP address of a service object, it should be fairly simple to replace it with similar
  discovery service.
- for example, one that comes bundled with another container orchestrator









Helm
- open source based package manager for kubernetes



common directory is boilerplate definition for the component chart.
