I find the patch command useful when making a number of changes to the same objects to try something out, for example,
to change the weight distribution in the routing rules. In this section, we will use the kubectl patch command to quickly
 change the weight distribution in the routing rules between the v1 and v2 versions of the microservices. To get the state
 of a virtual service after a few kubectl patch commands have been executed, a command such as kubectl get vs NNN -o yaml
 can be issued. For example, to get the state of the virtual service of the product microservice, issue the following
 command: kubectl get vs product -o yaml.
