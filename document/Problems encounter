solution:
	submodule need to add "<relativepath >" refrence to the parent pom


Problems I encountered Q and A

- more configuration error rather than coding problem
- Gradle to maven conversion
- Pom multi module project ordering
- docker can't build when perssistance is added, needs to have databaes running to build
  . needs to have embeded database(H2 for rsdb , and flapdoodle for no sql) for testing to build
 A: can do mvn clean package -DskipTests to skip the test or use embed database to do the test
- Embeded/in-memory MongoDB,Plapdoodle doesn't work with certain version of Spring boot. Spring boot 2.5 and later need to check documentation.
  will cause mongo template error.(Use Testcontainers instead now) Plapdoodle is not MongoDB official , so it's not exact

need a centralized place to store version of each dependecy in maven
- pom property is where to put version number


Mapstruct error with IntelliJ
- version 1.3.1 final don't work with IntelliJ
  There are several intellij bugs here. If I change the maven version 1.3.0.Final to 1.4.1.Final the intellij don't want to update the version.
-
might have issues with perssistance testing scope in pom.xml



the unit test the book provide doesn't really work with intelliJ
- mapstruck error version 1.31 and intelliJ conflict
- mapstruck setup processorPath error
- java version 1.8 or above
- gradle and maven difference


no H2 Testcontainers is not as performant as H2, but does give you the benefit of 100% database compatibility
